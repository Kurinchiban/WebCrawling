A stable was constructed in 1867, five blocks north at 4–8 Hubert Street.

The old buildings, dubbed by ", " as \"among the ancient landmarks\" of lower Broadway, were inadequate for such a rapidly expanding concern.\n", "After some delays due to the First World War, the 21-story ", " ", " was constructed in 1916–17 to the design of James L.
